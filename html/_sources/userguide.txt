User guide
========================

PyDropsondes is based on the interaction between a user (you) and the python-based scripts (aka, me).
Through a series of screen and key-board interactions the script will communicate with the user in order to select, process and create plots requested by the user.
This page provides a short description on how a new user might start to use PyDropsondes and possible problems that may arise when attempting to use this toolkit.

Roughly, PyDropsondes currently works as a user interface on a Linux command-line that interacts with the user to perform computations on dropsonde data suited to the users needs.
For this purpose, the interface uses manual input from the user to select the storm and secondly to produce desired output.


The interface provides menus and options for the user to guide him to select desired output (see :ref:`interface`).
The :meth:`gallery` section shows several examples are shown of possible output created with this toolbox.

A flowchart is presented below that details how the toolbox is constructed and operates showing the use of several python instances and
the need to create two files, a temporary and a period file. A temporary file is a file written while processing the dropsondes that is then used
to perform cylindrical wind computations. The period file is the final file with all measured and initially computed fields that are used to produce the output.

In short, results from a run from the PyDropsondes toolkit will include processed files and figure output (png files) that were requested by the user.

To quick-start PyDropsondes, go into the root PyDropsondes folder where the main file (main.py) is located and run.

>>> python3 main.py

After this, the :ref:`interface` should take over but, if you get lost, you have this Documentation to aid you.
