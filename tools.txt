The Toolbox
========================

The toolbox is the python-module where all recursive, repeated or long functions are
stored. It is quite the miscellaneous code wrapper and, as such, it includes a wide range of functions
for multiple purposes.

Cartesian to Cylindrical system change
----------------------------------------

Tropical Cyclones are better represented in a cylindrical system, where the distance to the center and the azimuth angle
describe the system.
One of the most important parameters to process observations in TCs is an accurate track, as such, the following set of functions are the most important processing section of this project.

The track used in this project is obtained from the flight-level data computation of the Willoughby-Chelmow track.
Flight-level and dropsonde observations are located in three-dimensional space through the use of a cartesian coordinate system with longitude, latitude and altitude.
However, TCs are best represented by cylindrical coordinates rather than cartesian coordinates.
A cylindrical coordinate system has three components :math:`[r,\Theta,z]` where :math:`r` is the radius to the axis-centre, $\Theta$ is the azimuth or angle from the centre axis to the point and $z$ is the vertical axis as in the cartesian coordinate system.
The following sections detail how the position and speed vectors are transformed from the cartesian to the coordinate system.

.. autofunction:: cart_to_cylindr
.. autofunction:: distance
.. autofunction:: plotdrift
.. autofunction:: getcenter

Kinematic and Thermodynamic Metrics
--------------------------------------
.. autofunction:: getgradwind
.. autofunction:: equivalent_potential_temperature
.. autofunction:: dp_dr
.. autofunction:: convergence_vorticity
.. autofunction:: stormu
.. autofunction:: potential_temperature



CAPE related metrics
----------------------
CAPE is a measure of severe weather events and is useful for weather forecasts of rain and winds.
However, in TCs it has found to be a less useful metric since their distribution and magnitude is not related to storm's intensity or intensity change.

Functions below were originally from Metpy module and have been modified for this project's needs to compute Convective Available Potential Energy
from the dropsoundings.

.. autofunction:: _find_append_zero_crossings
.. autofunction:: parcel_profile
.. autofunction:: cape_cin
.. autofunction:: cleanforcape




Other functions
------------------
.. autofunction:: getrack
.. autofunction:: plotdrift
