The Interface
========================

Python scripts can interact with a user in a variety of ways, either through a proper graphic interface,
the use of buttons in the mouse to direct and signal processing and through simpler, less sophisticated
user-script communication.

For this project, the latter case was chosen for the main reason that the purpose of
the visualization tool is mainly to produce output relevant for TC studies while less focus is placed
on how the visualization takes place.

Details.

1. As most connected-scripts, is written in Python 3.5 to be run in a Linux-GNU terminal.
2. Interaction with the user through simple questions where options are offered in advance.
3. Error control: the interface recognizes wrong choices by the user, as well as possibly misleading or
impossible calculations.
