Flightdata
========================

Aircrafts are one of the best (and more expensive tools) to make in-situ samplings of the atmosphere
with good spatial resolution. Tropical Cyclones are one of the best sampled phenomena through the use of
aircraft measurements.

After several successful attempts to sample Tropical Cyclones using aircraft, some remote sensing and in-situ instruments were deployed
on-board. As time elapsed, campaigns from `NOOA <https://www.omao.noaa.gov/learn/aircraft-operations/about/hurricane-hunters>`_, NASA and the US Air Force
have used radiometers, micrometers, radars, etc. These instruments are used to measure wind, reflectivity and other fields along the track of the aircraft.

Combined with the data of these instruments, this module also reads-in data from the `best track <https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat>`_ dataset to read-in this track and join it with the
one from the flight-level data.

    dropsondes from high altitudes (:math:`>10` km).
