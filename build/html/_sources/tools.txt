The Toolbox
========================

The toolbox is the python-module where all recursive, repeated or long functions are
stored. It is quite the miscelanous code wrapper and, as such, it includes a wide range of functions
for multiple purposes.

Cartesian to Cylindrical system change
----------------------------------------

Tropical Cyclones are better represented in a cylindrical system, where the distance to the center and the azimuth angle
describe the system.
The following set of functions are related to his tricky process and could be considered a keystone of this Computer Project.

.. autofunction:: cart_to_cylindr
.. autofunction:: distance
.. autofunction:: plotdrift
.. autofunction:: getcenter

Kinematic and Thermodynamic Metrics
--------------------------------------
.. autofunction:: getgradwind
.. autofunction:: equivalent_potential_temperature
.. autofunction:: dp_dr
.. autofunction:: convergence_vorticity
.. autofunction:: stormu
.. autofunction:: potential_temperature



CAPE related metrics
----------------------
CAPE is a measure of severe weather events and is useful for weather forecasts of rain and winds.
However, in TCs it has found to be a less useful metric since their distribution and magnitude is not related to storm's intensity or intensity change.

Functions below were originally from Metpy module and have been modified for this project's needs to compute Convective Available Potential Energy
from the dropsoundings.

.. autofunction:: _find_append_zero_crossings
.. autofunction:: parcel_profile
.. autofunction:: cape_cin
.. autofunction:: cleanforcape




Other functions
------------------
.. autofunction:: getrack
.. autofunction:: plotdrift
