Flightdata
========================

Aircrafts are one of the best (and more expensive) tools to make in-situ samplings of the atmosphere
with good spatial resolution.
In fact, Tropical Cyclones are one of the best suited phenomena to be sampled through the use of aircraft measurements due
to the predicaments and perils associated with the high winds and precipitation in these convective systems.

After several successful attempts to sample Tropical Cyclones using aircraft, some remote sensing and in-situ instruments were deployed
on-board. As time elapsed, campaigns from `NOOA <https://www.omao.noaa.gov/learn/aircraft-operations/about/hurricane-hunters>`_, NASA and the US Air Force
have used radiometers, micrometers, radars, etc. These instruments are used to measure wind, reflectivity and other fields along the track of the aircraft.
In 2015, :cite:`vigh2015flight` made public a dataset of flight level data that can be downloaded `here <https://verif.rap.ucar.edu/tcdata/flight/>`_.

From this flight level data three main parameters are used:

1) Storm track with resolution in the order of minutes.
2) Storm speed and motion with resolution in the order of tens of minutes.
3) Radius of Maximum wind timeseries (resolution of :math:`\sim` 10 minutes).

Combined with the data of these instruments, this module also reads-in data from the `best track <https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat>`_ dataset to read-in this track and join it with the
one from the flight-level data.

    NOAAâ€™s Gulfstream IV-SP (G-IV) typically used to sample the environment of Tropical Cyclones and usually launches
    dropsondes from high altitudes (:math:`>10` km).
