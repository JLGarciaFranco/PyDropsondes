Process Dropsondes
========================

This module will read-in all the droponsdes of a particular storm, select the dropsondes that are in and or near the inner core and finally
write all processed and cleaned fields into a txt file that can then be used to plot or post-process.

The dropsonde dataset from :cite:`wang2015` is provided with all the necessary filters and quality checks, however,
several NAN values are still reported, therefore some extra-care must be taken when reading-in and managing these observations.
